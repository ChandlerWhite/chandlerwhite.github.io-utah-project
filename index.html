					  	<hr class="green">
					  	<p>Arches National Park has more than 2,000 stone arches that range from thin cracks in the rock to the magnificent 300-foot long Landscape Arch. They are the result of millions of years of erosion, deposition, and other geological events that have affected the soft sandstone. Arches National Park is one of the most famous places to visit in Utah. The best times to go are early spring and fall.</p>

					  	<hr class="green">
					  	<p>The oldest and the most popular Utah National Park, Zion means “heavenly mountain” and the majesty of the surrounding nature inspires reverence.

Located in southwest Utah, the park is best known for its magnificent Zion Canyon red cliffs.</p>

					  	<hr class="green">
					  	<p>Monument Valley looks today the same way it looked thousands of years ago – you will see an endless horizon with an expansive skyline and enormous otherworldly buttes sticking out and separated by deep canyons. This attraction is one of the things to see in Utah. Created by millennia of relentless work on behalf of wind and water, the buttes can be seen in comfort from the 14-mile long dirt road that crosses the Valley.</p>

					  	<h3>Bryce Canyon National Park</h3>
					  	<hr class="green">
					  	<p>Bryce Canyon National Park is located in southwestern Utah. Although it is called a canyon, it is not a canyon but rather a series of enormous natural amphitheaters located along the eastern side of the Pausaugunt Plateau. The park is also known for its hoodoos: these are tall thin spires of rock that are also sometimes called earth pyramids, fairy chimneys, and tent rocks.</p>

					  	<h3>Great Salt Lake</h3>
					  	<hr class="green">
					  	<p>The Great Salt Lake, which borders the state's capital, Salt Lake City, is salty because its tributary rivers are constantly transporting small amounts of salt dissolved from the surrounding rocks in their water. The lake is one of the top Utah points of interest.Once the water comes to the Great Salt Lake, the water evaporates in heat, leaving the salt behind. The lake is 75 miles long and 35 miles wide, and it is spread over a number of flat basins.</p>
